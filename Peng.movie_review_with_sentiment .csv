1,"If you think of this movie as a nightmare it makes more sense. When you dream, your brain processes deep emotions and fears",Negative
2,I truly don't know where to start with this one. I've become a fan of director Ari Aster,Positive
3,"I think the best way to approach Beau Is Afraid is to consider it as a series of Inception-styled existentialist nightmares that the real-life Beau is experiencing as he is safely ensconced in his comfy apartment in an upscale part of town. Everything that happens in the movie is then figurative, merely how Beau's mind is trying to process and resolve the difficult aspects of his life that may be hidden from his consciousness",Positive
4,"I remember seeing a headline a few weeks ago in which it was claimed that Ari Aster dropped some LSD before a premiere. I don't know if that's true or not, or whether he takes psychedelics at all, but the man walks around with an imagination that is perpetually, creatively tripping",Positive
5,"The movie lost money because it was too long, the first half of the movie was great , the second half lost me. The scene in the forest and all the imaginary cartoon effects should have been eliminated greatly reducing the cost of the movie, The ending was silly, keeping it realistic would have enhanced the movie compared to what transpired",Positive
6,What do I even say? I don't know. This movie broke my brain,Negative
7,"A fascinating movie with an exceptional ending, can't tell how much I enjoyed the movie and the ending reminded me of another masterpiece the stranger by Albert Camus... Only this time the mother herself is the judge.The thing that makes this movie precious is that we don't see young directors delivering these kinds of movies specially at this quality",Positive
8,After being so mesmerised by hereditary and midsommar I was really looking forward to seeing this. The acting was really good,Positive
9,Beau is Afraid is going to be hit or miss for a lot of people. It's the type of movie that many will praise and criticize for the exact same reasons,Positive
10,Ari Aster still didn't manage to convince me completely. With Midsommar (that I rated a seven) and Hereditary (that I rated a six) he had already some weird ideas for stories so I was curious with what he would come up this time,Neutral
11,I loved what I have watched from Ari Aster...until this one movie. It is not that I dislike it,Positive
12,"Beau is Afraid demands us to see it again. It basically screams to be rewatched, paused, rewound, dissected, and examined",Negative
13,"This movie is very special and unique, and is definitely not for everyone. It is about a man, Beau, who gets a call that his mother has died",Positive
14,"Beau is Afraid has been somewhat panned by critics as being too self-indulgent or even pretentious. It's being said that it is a bombastic misstep that has befallen several other great auteurs early in their careers, drawing comparisons to Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia and last year's Babylon from Damien Chazelle",Positive
15,"This is Ari Aster's worst film. That's not to say it's bad, but it's his worst.The beginning of the movie starts off with this incredible burst of energy.Beau is this lonely guy talking his problems with a therapist and living in this dumpy apartment in some unnamed large city.But it's also a commentary on societal downfall and policymakers stupidity.It is absolute chaos in the streets",Negative
16,Couple things:1. I don't like being negative about movies.2,Positive
17,"This whole movie is an exercise in anxiety. It's pretty much ""Anxiety the Movie."" Not horrific, just claustrophobic to the point of suffocation",Positive
18,"""Beau is Afraid"" starts brilliantly, proceeds intriguingly, and finally gets so weird it becomes annoying and overstays its welcome.They say you only know how much is enough when you know how much is more than enough. I remember with Aster's previous movie ""Midsommar"", I actually considered turning it off early on, because it seemed massively overlong and moved very slowly",Neutral
19,"I won't write too much because the movie made me waste 3h of my life already.Three stars are for acting and production. Everything else would make me rate this movie as zero.The first third is ok, then it completely derails in nonsense without connections",Negative
20,"Oh my gosh it's brilliant, to a point.Watching this can only be equated to what I believe 500 cups of coffee, no sleep, and functioning mental illness combined would be like. Several times I actually stopped to rewind (or, whatever it's called now, I backed up a few frames) to rewatch what I just watched, shouting ""WTF just happened""...it's an adventure in madness, like a song with lyrics that take you from midnight through to 5pm the next day and you're still at the bar playing random jukebox tunes while everyone else has gone home",Negative
21,"This is the 3rd movie I've seen by Ari Aster. The first two were ""Midsommar"" and ""Hereditary""",Neutral
22,It takes a bit to let this movie truly sink in. It is one of the craziest fever-dream odyssey style movies I've ever seen,Positive
